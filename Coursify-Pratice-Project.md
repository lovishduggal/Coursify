# **Project Overview: Learning Management System (LMS)**

The Learning Management System (LMS) is a comprehensive web application designed to streamline and enhance the educational experience. Developed using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js), this LMS serves as a dynamic platform for managing and delivering educational content.

# **Key Features:**

1. **User Authentication:** Robust user authentication system ensures secure access for students and administrators.
2. **Course Management:** Intuitive tools for creating, updating, and organizing courses, including multimedia content.
3. **Subscription-based Platform**: Our platform operates on a subscription-based model. Users can access any course on the platform with a one-time payment.

# **Technology Stack:**

- **Frontend:**React.js for a responsive and dynamic user interface. Chakra UI for built-in components.
- **Backend:** Node.js and Express.js for efficient server-side development.
- **Database:** MongoDB for scalable and flexible data storage.
- **Authentication:** Secure user authentication using JWT (JSON Web Tokens).
- **Deployment:** Deployment on cloud platform, such as Vercel, for scalability and accessibility.

# **Key Learnings:**

- I have comprehended the process of building a MERN application.
- I have learned how to connect the frontend with the backend. I now have a good understanding of how the two parts of a web application can communicate with each other.
- I have a thorough understanding of the payment integration process.
- I have become proficient in performing CRUD operations.

# The things I did by my side:

- I utilized Redux-Toolkit Slices and the createAsyncThunk middleware to facilitate API calls.
- Deployment on Vercel.
